# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "üö® CRITICAL INSPECTION ASSIGNMENT BUG INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Comprehensive investigation of the critical bug where planned inspections are not appearing in inspector dashboard completed with 7/8 investigation areas successful. üéØ ROOT CAUSE FOUND: 1) ORPHANED INSPECTOR IDs - Found 1 inspection with inspector_id (951d0de5-3fa7-47ca-8f72-8b77465ee8a1) that doesn't match any actual user in the system, causing the inspection to be invisible in inspector dashboards, 2) INSPECTOR ASSIGNMENT MISMATCH - Out of 4 inspectors in system, only 1 (ƒ∞LKER MENGE) has inspections properly assigned, 3 inspectors have no assignments, 3) DATABASE INTEGRITY ISSUE - All inspections have inspector_id assigned (100% coverage) but 1 ID is invalid/orphaned. ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING: 1) Found 2 inspections with status 'beklemede' in database, 2) Found 4 active inspectors with role 'denetci', 3) Inspector ƒ∞LKER MENGE has 1 properly assigned inspection that should appear in dashboard, 4) All required fields (inspector_id, status, planned_date) are present in inspection documents. üîß CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED: 1) Data migration to fix orphaned inspector_id (951d0de5-3fa7-47ca-8f72-8b77465ee8a1), 2) Validation during inspection creation to prevent invalid inspector assignments, 3) Referential integrity checks between inspections and users. üéâ INVESTIGATION SUCCESSFUL: The bug is NOT in the dashboard filtering logic but in data integrity - inspections exist but have invalid inspector references, making them invisible to actual inspectors."

    message: "üéØ PRODUCTION DATA FIX VERIFICATION COMPLETED: Executed comprehensive production data analysis on https://royalcert-inspection-system-production.up.railway.app with admin credentials (admin/admin123). ‚úÖ PRODUCTION STATUS: The orphaned inspector ID issue has been RESOLVED in production. Found 2 'beklemede' inspections in production MongoDB Atlas, both with VALID inspector assignments - no orphaned inspector IDs detected. ‚úÖ INSPECTOR ASSIGNMENTS VERIFIED: 1) Mehmet Yƒ±lmaz assigned to 1 CARASKAL inspection (planned: 2025-01-20), 2) ƒ∞LKER MENGE assigned to 1 FORKLIFT inspection (planned: 2025-08-04), 3) All inspector_ids match actual users in system, 4) Inspector dashboard access working correctly. ‚úÖ DATA INTEGRITY CONFIRMED: All 4 active inspectors found in production system, 2 inspections properly assigned, 0 orphaned inspector IDs remaining. ‚ö†Ô∏è ENDPOINT STATUS: Data fix endpoint /api/fix/orphaned-inspector-ids returned 404 on production (may not be deployed), but analysis shows NO ORPHANED IDs EXIST - production data is already clean and properly assigned. üéâ PRODUCTION OUTCOME: The original orphaned inspector ID issue has been resolved in production. All planned inspections (CARASKAL + FORKLIFT) are properly assigned to valid inspectors (Mehmet Yƒ±lmaz and ƒ∞LKER MENGE) and visible in their respective dashboards. The production system is working correctly with proper inspection assignment integrity."

    message: "üîç TEMPLATE CONTROL ITEMS QUALITY CHECK COMPLETED: Comprehensive analysis of FORKLIFT MUAYENE FORMU template parsing quality completed successfully. ‚úÖ TEMPLATE ANALYSIS: Found FORKLIFT MUAYENE FORMU with 47 control items across 6 categories (A-F). ‚úÖ QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Template parsing quality is GOOD with acceptable minor issues. First 15 control items analyzed showing proper structure with meaningful inspection criteria. ‚úÖ PARSING QUALITY RESULTS: 1) Text length appropriate (0 too short, 1 too long), 2) No repetitive items found, 3) No broken/incomplete text, 4) No Turkish character corruption, 5) Minor issue: 6 header/label items mixed with control items (12.8%). ‚úÖ EXPECTED STRUCTURE COMPARISON: 80% coverage of expected forklift inspection items achieved - found exact matches for 'Y√∂nlendirme kumandalarƒ± ve i≈üaretleri' and 'S√ºrme ve frenleme kumandalarƒ± ve i≈üaretleri', plus 10 partial matches for other expected items. ‚úÖ PARSING PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED: Only 1 medium-severity issue found - Header/Label Contamination (6 items like 'Kaldƒ±rma Kapasitesi (kg)', 'Y√ºk merkezi mesafesi (mm)' mixed with actual control items). üéØ OUTCOME: Word parsing algorithm is working well with reasonable control item counts (47 ‚â§ 60 limit) and good content quality. Recommendation: Enhance filtering to exclude measurement fields and specification labels from control items list."

    message: "üö® CRITICAL UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE PARSER ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Comprehensive testing of the Universal Template Parser revealed a critical backend implementation gap. ‚úÖ PARSING LOGIC FUNCTIONAL: The parse_universal_template_structure() function correctly creates all 11 universal sections during Word document parsing (general_info, measurement_devices, equipment_info, test_values, control_items, categories, test_experiments, defect_explanations, notes, result_opinion, inspector_info, company_official). ‚ùå DATABASE MODEL INCOMPLETE: The EquipmentTemplate Pydantic model only includes legacy fields and excludes all universal structure fields, causing them to be lost when saving to MongoDB. ‚ùå UNIVERSAL STRUCTURE NOT STORED: Templates in database only contain old format fields (id, name, equipment_type, template_type, description, categories as list, created_by, is_active, created_at, updated_at). All universal fields are missing from stored templates. üîß ROOT CAUSE: EquipmentTemplate model needs updating to include universal template structure fields. The parsing creates the structure but the data model doesn't persist it. üéØ IMPACT: Universal Template Parser appears to work during upload but doesn't actually store the universal structure, making it non-functional for its intended purpose. CRITICAL FIX NEEDED: Update EquipmentTemplate model to include all 11 universal structure fields."
